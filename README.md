# DinoRun 
A simple runner style game using standard C and SDL.


## Building
To build you will need a C compiler, all compile instructions are in the makefile so run ```make```.
The make file is needed for a successful compile (there are some defined global variables in there) and the linking
gets somewhat complicated. 

## Note
This is not a finished project, it is in early development (and may stay this way for quite some time).

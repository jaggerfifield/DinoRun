# DinoRun 
A simple runner style game using standard C and SDL.

To build you will need a C compiler, all compile instructions are in the makefile so run ```make``` to quickly compile (if make is installed on your system).

This is not a finished project, it is in early development (and may stay this way for quite some time).
